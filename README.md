# NEAT Flappy bird 
An AI that learns to play Flappy bird game using the NEAT python module . NEAT creates  neural network for every bird from the population and train itself to passthrough pipes. With each generation Bird learns more and tries to beats the game.

## Neural Network inputs :
1. Position of bird
2. Distance from the Top Pipe
3. Distance from the Bottom Pipe
   
## Neural Network output :
1. Bird jump ( if bird should jump or not )

## Modules used :
1.  pygame for building the Dino run - ``` pip install pygame ```
2.  NEAT python module to make AI that plays the game - ``` pip install neat-python ```
